**`Full Stack Developer (Developer/Designer/Creator)`**

I am a newbie in the coding scene, but I am eager to become a full-stack developer. I have a strong desire to learn and improve my skills, and I am excited about the challenges that lie ahead.

One of my unique qualities is my willingness to share my journey with others. I plan to publish all of my work and invite others to join me on my journey. I believe that collaboration and community are powerful tools, and I am excited to work with others to achieve great things.

I know that becoming a full-stack developer will require hard work and dedication, but I am up for the challenge. I am determined to succeed and will not give up until I reach my goal. I am excited to see where this journey will take me and can't wait to see what the future holds!

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 GylanSalih's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
